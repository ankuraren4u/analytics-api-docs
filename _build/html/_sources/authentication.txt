Authentication
--------------
You authenticate to the Zendrive API endpoint by providing your application key in the request parameters. The application key must be specified as the apikey query parameter. It is a required parameter in every API request. `Sign Up<http://zendrive.com>` to get your API key. Your API key carries many privileges, so keep it secret and secure!

All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail.
